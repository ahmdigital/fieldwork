# Fieldwork

Inspect your Sanity.io schema fields straight in your Studio using this tool

## Some use cases
- See what you've got in preparation for adding new schemas, so you can maximise re-use.
- See where you can simplify things. Its useful for everyone to have fields with the same name act the same.

## Installation

1. `sanity install fieldwork`
2. There's no step 2.

## Contributing

Yes, please!

Repo still needs a way of running locally without a studio, but for now use `npm link` and develop it against your own studio.

Will add a CD integration to npm if this takes off. For now we at least have CI for lint.
